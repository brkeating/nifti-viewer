# Web-based Medical Image Viewer

All of the options that I tried didn't work for me, were buggy, or didn't have enough functionality. This repo is my attempt to create a useful image viewer with [plotly dash's `dash_slicer` module](https://dash.plotly.com/slicer).

TODO:
* slider for overlay alpha
* slider(s) for windowing
* option to show 3 views of same image *or* axial views of all slices
